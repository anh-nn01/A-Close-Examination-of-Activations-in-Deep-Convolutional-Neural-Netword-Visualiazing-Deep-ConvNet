# A-Close-Examination-of-Activations-in-Deep-Convolutional-Neural-Netword-Visualiazing-Deep-ConvNet
Convolutional Neural Network has proven its impressive effectiveness in Deep Learning, especially Computer Vision. It remarkably reduces the complexity in many Computer Vision tasks and make complex tasks possible, such as Real-time Object Detection. Inspired by the curiousity why it works so well, many prominent research scientists have conducted research to get a better understanding of what Convolutional Neural Network actually does. This project provides a source code which allow everyone examine and visualize the activations in different convnet layers themselves to develop a better understanding and intuition about Convolutional Neural Network.
